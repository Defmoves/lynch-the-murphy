## Aim
We're putting our money where our mouths are and building a motherfucking game. In keeping with the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) the initial alpha will have zero assets, zero colours, and be in 2D. We'll start with the most basic of primitives and see if we can iterate our way to a unique gameplay mechanic. Once that is established, we can go fucking nuts with the assets.

As well as having a laugh and giving us an excuse to collaborate, this also presents an avenue to for us all to level up our coding skills. Hence I call to attention our collective interest in learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in this endeavour.

## Platform
_For your consideration:_

### [Unity](https://unity.com/) 
âž•
Has a relatively low barrier to entry, cross platform support and huge, well established community. 

âž–
The only issue is it's reliance on C#. That said it does seem possible integrate [RUST](https://dev.to/manhunterita/call-into-rust-from-c-and-unity-23bp) here.

### [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) 

âž•
A mature open source game engine, which can work with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) via the third party project, [godot-rust](https://godot-rust.github.io/)

âž–
Not as popular or as successful as [Unity](https://unity.com/). Reliant on thrd party to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). 

### [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)
âž•
New on the scene yet met with huge community excitement it is open source and [Rust native](https://www.rust-lang.org/) game library.

âž–
It's still very young, and is only a library. There are no GUIs yet (though they will likely come) right now it's all code based.
